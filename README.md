## AKQA Take Home Test

This repository contains the analysis for AKQA's take home test for its Machine Learning Apprenticeship. The deliverable file is the `AKQA_TakeHome_Analysis.pdf` file, which was compiled from the ipython notebook of the same name. There are some formatting issues in the pdf that seemed to occur when the notebook was compiled in LaTeX, so if you're reading the analysis on this repository it would be better to look at the ipython notebook. All of the relevant analysis is easily viewable in the pdf, but some of the code printouts don't fit the margins.

A helper function to clean the data is in the `work.py` file, while the instructions are in `AKQA_Data_Science_Exercise_revised.pdf`, and the data is in `AKQA_Dataset_Test.xlsx`.
